### (Almost) debloated and (almost) based neovim config

Native plugin manager, native lsp, good workflow.

## Before installation

You need to install some **Language Severs**:
```bash
# On Arch linux with yay
yay -S jdtls lua-language-server llvm rust-analyzer
```
And make sure you are using Neovim 0.12 or greater.
